Django-payline
==============

Django-payline helps you make payments with Payline_ quickly and easily.

.. _Payline: http://www.payline.com/

Design
------

The way this is done is by creating a *Payline wallet* with the payment
information provided by the user, storing this *wallet ID* in a ``Wallet``
model, and allowing payments to be done using this *wallet*.

Each payment's *transaction ID* is stored in a ``Transaction`` model.

The source code is `available on Github`_ under the 3-clause BSD license.

Installation
------------

Django-payline makes use of class-based views. It's been written for Django 1.3
but compatibility with older versions is provided using the `django-cbv`
package.

.. _django-cbv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-cbv

If you have Django >= 1.3:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-payline

If you have Django < 1.3:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-payline django-cbv

Then add ``payline`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and create the necessary
tables:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py syncdb

Usage
-----

You need to add to your project:

* the URLs
* if you need something different than the default scenario, an implementation
  of the payment login.

.. note:: Some very basic templates are provided if you need to use or extend
          them.

First, create an app. Let's call it ``payment``:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py startapp payment

Add some URLs in ``payment/urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url

    from payment import views


    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^wallet/$', views.view_wallet, name='view_wallet'),
        url(r'^wallet/new/$', views.create_wallet, name='create_wallet'),
        url(r'^wallet/update/$', views.update_wallet, name='update_wallet'),
    )

Finally, add the ``payment/views.py`` you referenced in ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from payline.views import ViewWallet, CreateWallet, UpdateWallet


    view_wallet = ViewWallet.as_view()
    update_wallet = UpdateWallet.as_view()
    create_wallet = CreateWallet.as_view()

You can now create wallets, update them, view them, and use them:

* ``make_payment``: takes an amount in Euros (â‚¬), and ask Payline to make a
  payment from this *wallet*
* ``is_valid``: returns True if the card expiry date is in the future
* ``expires_this_month``: returns True if the card expires this month
* ``transaction_set``: manager that accesses the *transactions* made on this
  *wallet*

Extension points
----------------

``payline.views.CreateWallet`` is a `CreateView`_, and
``payline.views.UpdateWallet`` is an `UpdateView`_. The default wallet form
asks for:

.. _CreateView: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#createview
.. _UpdateView: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#updateview

* A first and last name
* The card number
* The card type
* The card expiry
* The card cvx code

The default form checks that the expiry date is in the future, obfuscates the
card number (before storing it in the database), and makes sure the information
are correct (by creating a *Wallet* on the Payline service, using its API)
before creating and storing a *Wallet* locally.

This default form is used both for creating and updating the *Wallet*.

If you want to perform extra validation, or modify the logic, just subclass the
form, and pass it to the class-based view, as `you would normally do`_.

.. _you would normally do: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/generic-views/

Advanced usage
--------------

Most of the time, there is a *Wallet* linked to the logged in user. Thus,
creating, updating or viewing of **this** *Wallet* only should be allowed.

This can easily be done, for example using a mixin, if there's a ``wallet``
foreign key added to the user's profile, pointing to ``payline.models.Wallet``:

.. code-block:: python

    from payline import views


    class GetWalletMixin(object):
        def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            """View current wallet if it exists, or redirect to create view."""
            profile = request.user.get_profile()
            if profile.wallet is None:
                return redirect('create_wallet')
            kwargs['pk'] = profile.wallet.pk
            return super(GetWalletMixin, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)


    class ViewWallet(GetWalletMixin, views.ViewWallet):
        pass
    view_wallet = ViewWallet.as_view()


    class UpdateWallet(GetWalletMixin, views.UpdateWallet):
        pass
    update_wallet = UpdateWallet.as_view()


    class CreateWallet(views.CreateWallet):

        def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            """Redirect to update view if wallet exists."""
            profile = request.user.get_profile()
            if profile.wallet is None:
                return redirect('update_wallet')
            return super(CreateWallet, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
    create_wallet = CreateWallet.as_view()


Changes
-------

* 0.5: removed useless ordering on 'pk'
* 0.4: fixing missing wsdl (for good)
* 0.3: fixing wsdl (again)
* 0.2: missing wsdl file in the distribution
* 0.1: initial version
